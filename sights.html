        <span class="title">GLEN AFFRIC</span><br /><br />Often referred to as
        ‘the most beautiful glen in Scotland’, no visit to the area is complete
        without at least driving up to the Glen Affric car park and walking up
        to the lodge.<br /><br />However, for the keen walker there is a 10 mile
        circuit (4-6 hours) of Loch Affric which lets you experience the true
        splendour of the area, with towering snow-capped mountains, and along
        the side of the path, the remnants of the ancient Caledonian forest
        dating back thousands of years. Take a packed lunch and stop at
        Strawberry Cottage to admire the views.

        <span class="title">CALANAIS</span><br /><br />On the western edge of
        the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, overlooking the waters of Loch
        Roag, stand the mysterious Calanais standing stones. Erected around 5000
        years ago, the stones form a circle surrounded by a cruciform shape, and
        are believed to have been an important site of ritual activity during
        the Bronze Age.<br /><br />A chambered tomb is also contained within the
        site but this is believed to have been added at a later date. Numerous
        other sites lie nearby, many within view of the main site, including
        several other stone circles and single stones. It is believed that this
        area was a focus for ritual and religious activity for over 1500 years,
        before finally being abandoned around 800 BCE.
