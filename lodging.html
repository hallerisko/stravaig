        of the River Ness, lies Ness Walk. An idyllic 5-star retreat hotel in
        Inverness, just 10 minutes from Loch Ness.<br /><br />Surrounded by a
        dramatic canopy of impressive trees, our grand building allows you to
        experience a secluded atmosphere in the heart of the vibrant city
        centre. Originally a 19th century house, our lovingly restored Grade B

        with modern design and architecture, providing a flawless balance
        between past and present.<br /><br />Ness Walk is also home to the
        Torrish Restaurant. Presenting the perfect combination of innovation and
