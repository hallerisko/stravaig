        <span class="title">STACKS</span><br /><br />Come and enjoy Stacks deli,
        bakery, and coffee house. All of Stack’s food is made fresh, to order
        and in-house with lots of creative licence! Comfort food takes time, but
        it's worth the wait! Menus are seasonal to keep the very best on the
        plate all year round.<br /><br />Food waste is a major problem in
        Scotland & Stacks boasts an impressive rate of less than 5%, reducing
        their impact on the big rock we call home.<br /><br />Stacks was created
        to offer a warm space for everything from business meetings, a
        celebration dinner or just a cup of coffee with your four-legged friend!
